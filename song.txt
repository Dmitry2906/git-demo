In the beginning God created Heaven and Earth.
For what it's worth, I think that he might've created you first,
Just my opinion. Your body is the one paradise
That I wanna fly to every day and every night.

Practice my confession,
In case I take the stand
I'll say I learned my lesson,
I'll be a better man
