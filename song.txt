In the beginning God created Heaven and Earth.
For what it's worth, I think that he might've created you first,
Just my opinion. Your body is the one paradise
That I wanna fly to every day and every night.
<<<<<<< HEAD

Born of cold and winter air
And mountain rain combining...
This icy force both foul and fair
Has a frozen heart worth mining

Stepped through the gate, and I'm all alone
I had chicken on the plate, but the food was cold
Then I covered up my face so that no one knows
I didn't want trouble, I'm the boy in the bubble
