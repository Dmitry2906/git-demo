In the beginning God created Heaven and Earth.
For what it's worth, I think that he might've created you first,
Just my opinion. Your body is the one paradise
That I wanna fly to every day and every night.

I never got your number
Am I reading into your smile
Or am I reading between your lips?
Was that a spark, am I imagining this?
