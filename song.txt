In the beginning God created Heaven and Earth.
For what it's worth, I think that he might've created you first,
Just my opinion. Your body is the one paradise
That I wanna fly to every day and every night.

Born of cold and winter air
And mountain rain combining...
This icy force both foul and fair
Has a frozen heart worth mining
